2001 Game

Implement the game of 2001. Below you will find the rules.

2001 â€“ Game Rules
Each player starts with 0 points.
In their turn, a player rolls 2 dice (standard D6 dice). The number of obtained pips is added to the total score.
Starting from the second turn:
if a player rolls a 7, they divide their number of points by 7, disregarding the fractional part,
if the player rolls an 11, they multiply the current number of points by 11.
The player who first reaches 2001 points wins.

Implementation
Implement a two-player version of the game. It should be a console application. The other player should be a computer.
Display the current score after each turn.
The player's roll should take place when the user presses the enter key. The computer's roll occurs automatically,
after the player's roll. Terminate the program when either the player or the computer exceeds 2001 points.
